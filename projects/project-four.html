                    Older adults fall frequently, and head trauma during a fall can be life-changing.

                    can work together to reduce head-impact severity when a fall with a lower-limb

                        I. Introduction – Why Safe Falling Matters

                    <div class="space-y-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
                        <p>
                            Exoskeletons are typically designed to make walking easier, 
                            but older adults consistently rank fall prevention and fall safety 
                            as the most important feature they want from these devices. 
                            Falls are common in this population, and head impact during a fall 
                            can cause severe neurotrauma, loss of independence, or even death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most current exoskeleton controllers focus on energy savings and gait assistance, 
                            not on what the device should do once a destabilizing push makes a fall inevitable. 
                            This project proposes a safety-critical control framework that explicitly targets 
                            the high-risk phase of a fall and aims to reduce the chance and severity of head impact.

                            Concretely, the objective was to integrate Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis 
                            with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning in a physics-accurate MuJoCo 
                            humanoid model, and to evaluate whether this hybrid controller could learn 
                            safe falling strategies for a lower-limb exoskeleton user.

                        <p>
                            The starting point was a simplified lower-limb exoskeleton model that can apply 
                            torque at the hip and knee joints while the human body is represented by a 
                            3D MuJoCo humanoid. The system state includes joint angles and velocities, 
                            as well as the three-dimensional position and velocity of key body segments, 
                            with a special focus on the head.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To capture injury risk, the project defined a <em>failure set</em> of states in which 
                            the head is on or through the ground, and an <em>unsafe set</em> of states from which 
                            head impact becomes unavoidable under worst-case disturbances. A signed-distance function combines head height 
                            and vertical head velocity to estimate how much stopping distance remains before 
                            the head would impact the ground at a tolerable deceleration level.

                    </h3>
                    <div class="space-y-3 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
                        <p>
                            Hamilton–Jacobi reachability was used to approximate the backward-reachable tube 
                            of the unsafe set. A neural network learned a value function that maps each state 
                            to a safety value: positive values are safe, and negative values indicate states 
                            from which head impact cannot be avoided under worst-case disturbances.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The gradient of this value function provides a direction in state space that most 
                            quickly increases safety. When the safety value becomes negative or close to zero, 
                            the controller can override the nominal action and apply a “safety control” that 
                            steers the system away from high-risk configurations.

                        <p>
                            The safety analysis was embedded into a Soft Actor-Critic reinforcement learning loop. 
                            During simulation, the humanoid starts in a standing posture, then experiences a 
                            randomized horizontal push of 150–600&nbsp;N to the torso after 0.5&nbsp;s. 
                            From this moment on, the policy must decide how to use only hip and knee torques 
                            to manage the fall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At each time step, the environment computes the safety value and its gradient. 
                            If the state is considered safe, the SAC policy chooses the action. 
                            If the state enters the backward-reachable tube, the safety control 
                            replaces the SAC action. The reward function penalizes low head height 
                            and adds an extra penalty when the safety value is negative, so the critic 
                            learns to assign low value to trajectories that pass through unsafe regions.

                            Training was run for 100 episodes, where each episode contained multiple epochs 
                            of simulated falls with varying push directions and magnitudes. 
                            Throughout these runs, the cumulative reward stayed negative, which suggests 
                            that the controller was unable to consistently prevent head contact with the ground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Visual inspection of the learned policies confirmed that the exoskeleton torques 
                            rarely generated large, coordinated motions that could meaningfully reorient the body. 
                            Even when actuator limits were relaxed, the controller did not discover strategies 
                            such as rotating the torso, tucking the head, or directing impact toward a safer body segment.

                            These findings show that, in its current form, the hybrid HJ–SAC framework 
                            did not yet produce a reliable safe-falling controller, but it did reveal 
                            several important design constraints and failure modes.

                            The safety penalty is large at the beginning of training, 
                            which prevents the SAC policy from discovering even moderately helpful behaviors 
                            before the value function becomes reliable.

                            <span class="font-semibold">High dimensionality:</span> 
                            Learning an accurate safety value function for a full humanoid is challenging, 
                            and implementation bugs or approximation errors can easily obscure the 
                            intended backward-reachable tube.

                            Making the upper body completely rigid prevents realistic failure modes, 
                            while leaving it fully articulated makes the control problem harder. 
                            Both extremes affected how informative the training data was.

                            Even though the controller did not converge to a successful policy, 
                            the project demonstrates how safety analysis can be tightly integrated with 
                            modern deep reinforcement learning. The work also clarifies when that integration 
                            may fail, for example when the safety penalty overwhelms the task reward 
                            or when the control authority is fundamentally insufficient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A promising next step is to reformulate the problem as safe trajectory tracking 
                            rather than as a static “avoid head impact” condition. In that view, 
                            Hamilton–Jacobi reachability could guarantee that the exoskeleton can still 
                            follow a pre-designed safe-fall motion under worst-case pushes, making 
                            martial-arts-inspired strategies like UKEMI more realistic for exoskeleton users.

                            Future simulations on lower-dimensional models such as Walker2D, 
                            followed by richer sensing and possibly additional hardware (for example, 
                            deployable supports), could bring this framework closer to a deployable 
                            safe-falling system for real users.
