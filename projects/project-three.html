          Falls during everyday walking are a leading cause of injury for
          people with lower-limb impairments. Wearable exoskeletons could
          react faster than human reflexes, but they need controllers that
          keep users stable under unexpected disturbances and that can be
          personalized to each person’s gait. In this project, I explored how
          optimal control can both stabilize a standing person in a moving
          vehicle and generate synthetic, personalized gait data to make
          exoskeletons safer and easier to tune.

            Introduction
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Many stroke survivors, veterans with neurotrauma, and older adults
            rely on assistive devices but still face a high risk of falls while
            walking or standing in dynamic environments such as buses and
            trains. Exoskeletons can apply corrective torques at the hip, knee,
            and ankle faster than humans can react, yet current controllers
            struggle with two challenges: maintaining balance under
            unpredictable platform motion, and collecting enough
            person-specific gait data to personalize assistance.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            This project investigates two complementary solutions. First, I
            design a linear–quadratic regulator (LQR) that keeps a simulated
            humanoid balanced on a randomly moving platform, with and without
            added support structures like railings and a hip exoskeleton.
            Second, I use iterative linear–quadratic Gaussian control (iLQG) to
            transfer a real person’s gait from motion capture data into
            simulation, enabling the future placement of virtual IMUs and
            rapid, personalized controller tuning without extensive lab data
            collection.

            LQR balancing on a moving platform
          </h4>
          <p class="mt-2">
            I built on DeepMind’s MuJoCo humanoid model with 27 degrees of
            freedom and 21 torque-controlled joints. After linearizing the
            dynamics around an upright standing pose, I solved the
            discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation to obtain an LQR
            state-feedback controller that regulates the humanoid’s state while
            the floor undergoes random velocity perturbations in the forward–
            backward direction.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            To understand how physical aids affect stability, I ran four
            experiments:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 ml-4 list-disc space-y-1 text-slate-300">
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Experiment&nbsp;1 – Fixed feet:</span>
              both feet were welded to the platform to test the best-case
              stabilization performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Experiment&nbsp;2 – Free feet:</span>
              the constraints were removed so the controller had to manage
              ankle and whole-body dynamics without enforced contact.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Experiment&nbsp;3 – Railing support:</span>
              I added a waist-height railing and extended the cost function to
              keep the hands near the rail, encouraging the humanoid to use it
              for support.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Experiment&nbsp;4 – Hip exoskeleton:</span>
              I modeled a simplified hip exoskeleton as hinged rods along each
              thigh, disabled the humanoid’s native hip motors, and applied
              LQR control through the exoskeleton actuators.
            </li>
          </ul>

            iLQG real-to-sim gait tracking
          </h4>
          <p class="mt-2">
            To generate personalized synthetic gait data, I used iLQG to track
            human motion in MuJoCo. I warm-started the optimization with a
            model predictive control (MPC) walking policy and aligned it in
            time with a real walking trial from the CMU motion capture
            database. For each frame, I defined a cost that penalized deviation
            between 16 selected humanoid keypoints and (1) the mocap keypoints
            and (2) the MPC reference gait, along with a control-effort term.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            MuJoCo’s analytical Jacobians provided the linearized dynamics and
            cost derivatives for the backward Riccati pass. After computing
            feedback gains, I performed a line search over control updates,
            accepted trajectories that reduced total cost, and rolled them out
            to iteratively refine the walking policy.

            LQR balance robustness
          </h4>
          <p class="mt-2">
            With fixed feet (Experiment&nbsp;1), the LQR controller maintained
            balance even when the platform experienced random velocities
            between –5.1&nbsp;m/s and 5.1&nbsp;m/s at every time step. When I
            removed the foot constraints (Experiment&nbsp;2), the maximum
            tolerable perturbation dropped sharply to about 0.36&nbsp;m/s,
            showing how strongly platform–foot coupling contributes to
            stability.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Adding a railing (Experiment&nbsp;3) modestly improved robustness,
            increasing the maximum stable perturbation speed to roughly
            0.45&nbsp;m/s as the humanoid learned to lean on the rail. The hip
            exoskeleton in Experiment&nbsp;4 successfully balanced the
            humanoid under smaller perturbations (about ±0.1&nbsp;m/s) and
            produced hip-joint angle trajectories that closely matched the
            exoskeleton’s commanded torques, confirming correct coupling
            between exoskeleton actuation and leg motion.

            iLQG gait-tracking performance
          </h4>
          <p class="mt-2">
            After tuning the relative weights on mocap tracking, MPC
            consistency, and control effort, the iLQG controller reproduced the
            subject’s walking pattern for an average of 4.8&nbsp;seconds (±
            1.06&nbsp;s) out of a 7-second trial across 30 runs—roughly 70% of
            the full trajectory. Beyond this horizon, accumulated errors
            triggered large corrective torques that destabilized the humanoid
            and led to a fall, highlighting where better dynamics alignment and
            torque constraints are needed.

            Discussion &amp; Impact
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Together, these studies show that optimal control can both
            stabilize exoskeleton users and reduce the data burden of
            personalization. The LQR experiments provide a clear picture of how
            design choices—such as railings or hip exoskeletons—change the
            range of disturbances a person can safely tolerate. The iLQG
            pipeline demonstrates that we can start from a few seconds of
            motion capture data and create a physics-consistent walking model
            that is suitable for placing virtual IMUs and exploring sensor
            layouts before running physical experiments.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            In future work, I plan to expand the exoskeleton model to multiple
            joints, add realistic mass and contact forces, track joint angles
            directly rather than sparse keypoints, and use the synthetic data to
            train learning-based exoskeleton controllers (such as temporal
            convolutional networks) that include LQR-style safety overrides for
            extreme disturbances.
